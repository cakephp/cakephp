<h3>Could this be caused by using Auto-Tables?</h3>
<p>
Some of the Table objects in your application were created by instantiating "<strong>Cake\ORM\Table</strong>"
instead of any other specific subclass.
</p>
<p>This could be the cause for this exception. Auto-Tables are created for you under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The class for the specified table does not exist.</li>
	<li>The Table was created with a typo: <strong><em>TableRegistry::get('Atricles');</em></strong></li>
	<li>The class file has a typo in the name or incorrect namespace: <strong><em>class Atricles extends Table</em></strong></li>
	<li>The file containing the class has a typo or incorrect casing: <strong><em>Atricles.php</em></strong></li>
	<li>The Table was used using associations but the association has a typo: <strong><em>$this->belongsTo('Atricles')</em></strong></li>
	<li>The table class resides in a Plugin but <strong><em>no plugin notation</em></strong> was used in the association definition.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Please try correcting the issue for the following table aliases:</p>
<ul>
<?php foreach ($autoTables as $alias => $table) : ?>
	<li><strong><?= $alias ?></strong></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
<br/>
