/**
 * This abstract class represents a filter to be applied to a dispatcher cycle. It acts as as
 * event listener with the ability to alter the request or response as needed before it is handled
 * by a controller or after the response body has already been built.
 *
 * Subclasses of this class use a class naming convention having a `Filter` suffix.
 *
 * ### Limiting filters to specific paths
 *
 * By using the `for` option you can limit with request paths a filter is applied to.
 * Both the before and after event will have the same conditions applied to them. For
 * example, if you only wanted a filter applied to blog requests you could do:
 *
 * {{{
 * $filter = new BlogFilter(['for' => '/blog']);
 * }}}
 *
 * When the above filter is connected to a dispatcher it will only fire
 * its `beforeDispatch` and `afterDispatch` methods on requests that start with `/blog`.
 *
 * The for condition can also be a regular expression by using the `preg:` prefix:
 *
 * {{{
 * $filter = new BlogFilter(['for' => 'preg:#^/blog/\d+$#']);
 * }}}
 *
 * ### Limiting filters based on conditions
 *
 * In addition to simple path based matching you can use a closure to match on arbitrary request
 * or response conditions. For example:
 *
 * {{{
 * $cookieMonster = new CookieFilter([
 *   'when' => function ($req, $res) {
 *     // Custom code goes here.
 *   }
 * ]);
 * }}}
 *
 * If your when condition returns `true` the before/after methods will be called.
 *
 * When using the `for` or `when` matchers, conditions will be re-checked on the before and after
 * callback as the conditions could change during the dispatch cycle.
 *
