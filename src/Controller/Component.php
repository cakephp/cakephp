/**
 * Base class for an individual Component. Components provide reusable bits of
 * controller logic that can be composed into a controller. Components also
 * provide request life-cycle callbacks for injecting logic at specific points.
 *
 * ### Initialize hook
 *
 * Like Controller and Table, this class has an initialize() hook that you can use
 * to add custom 'constructor' logic. It is important to remember that each request
 * (and sub-request) will only make one instance of any given component.
 *
 * ### Life cycle callbacks
 *
 * Components can provide several callbacks that are fired at various stages of the request
 * cycle. The available callbacks are:
 *
 * - `beforeFilter(EventInterface $event)`
 *   Called before Controller::beforeFilter() method by default.
 * - `startup(EventInterface $event)`
 *   Called after Controller::beforeFilter() method, and before the
 *   controller action is called.
 * - `beforeRender(EventInterface $event)`
 *   Called before Controller::beforeRender(), and before the view class is loaded.
 * - `afterFilter(EventInterface $event)`
 *   Called after the action is complete and the view has been rendered but
 *   before Controller::afterFilter().
 * - `beforeRedirect(EventInterface $event $url, Response $response)`
 *   Called before a redirect is done. Allows you to change the URL that will
 *   be redirected to by returning a Response instance with new URL set using
 *   Response::location(). Redirection can be prevented by stopping the event
 *   propagation.
 *
 * While the controller is not an explicit argument for the callback methods it
 * is the subject of each event and can be fetched using EventInterface::getSubject().
 *
