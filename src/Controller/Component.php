/**
 * Base class for an individual Component. Components provide reusable bits of
 * controller logic that can be composed into a controller. Components also
 * provide request life-cycle callbacks for injecting logic at specific points.
 *
 * ## Life cycle callbacks
 *
 * Components can provide several callbacks that are fired at various stages of the request
 * cycle. The available callbacks are:
 *
 * - `initialize()` - Called before the controller's beforeFilter method.
 * - `startup()` - Called after the controller's beforeFilter method,
 *   and before the controller action is called.
 * - `beforeRender()` - Called before the Controller beforeRender, and
 *   before the view class is loaded.
 * - `shutdown()` - Called after the action is complete and the view has been rendered.
 *    but before Controller::afterFilter().
 * - `beforeRedirect()` - Called before Controller::redirect(), and
 *   before a redirect() is done. Allows you to replace the URL that will
 *   be redirected to with a new URL. The return of this method can either be an
 *   array or a string. If the return is an array and contains a 'url' key.
 *   You may also supply the following:
 *
 *   - `status` The status code for the redirect
 *   - `exit` Whether or not the redirect should exit.
 *
 *   If your response is a string or an array that does not contain a 'url' key it will
 *   be used as the new URL to redirect to.
 *
 * Each callback has a slightly different signature:
 *
 * - `intitalize(Event $event)`
 * - `startup(Event $event)`
 * - `beforeRender(Event $event)`
 * - `beforeRedirect(Event $event $url, Response $response)`
 * - `shutdown(Event $event)`
 *
 * While the controller is not an explicit argument it is the subject of each event
 * and can be fetched using Event::subject().
 *
