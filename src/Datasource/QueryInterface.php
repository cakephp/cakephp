    /**
     * Adds a condition or set of conditions to be used in the WHERE clause for this

     * comparison operators in it, the values for the array will be used for comparing
     * the field to such literal. Finally, conditions can be expressed as a single
     * string or an array of strings.
     *
     * When using arrays, each entry will be joined to the rest of the conditions using
     * an AND operator. Consecutive calls to this function will also join the new
     * conditions specified using the AND operator. Additionally, values can be
     * expressed using expression objects which can include other query objects.
     *
     * Any conditions created with this methods can be used with any SELECT, UPDATE
     * and DELETE type of queries.
     *
     * ### Conditions using operators:
     *
     * ```
     *  $query->where([
     *      'posted >=' => new DateTime('3 days ago'),
     *      'title LIKE' => 'Hello W%',
     *      'author_id' => 1,
     *  ], ['posted' => 'datetime']);
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE posted >= 2012-01-27 AND title LIKE 'Hello W%' AND author_id = 1`
     *
     * Second parameter is used to specify what type is expected for each passed
     * key. Valid types can be used from the mapped with Database\Type class.
     *
     * ### Nesting conditions with conjunctions:
     *
     * ```
     *  $query->where([
     *      'author_id !=' => 1,
     *      'OR' => ['published' => true, 'posted <' => new DateTime('now')],
     *      'NOT' => ['title' => 'Hello']
     *  ], ['published' => boolean, 'posted' => 'datetime']
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE author_id = 1 AND (published = 1 OR posted < '2012-02-01') AND NOT (title = 'Hello')`
     *
     * You can nest conditions using conjunctions as much as you like. Sometimes, you
     * may want to define 2 different options for the same key, in that case, you can
     * wrap each condition inside a new array:
     *
     * `$query->where(['OR' => [['published' => false], ['published' => true]])`
     *
     * Keep in mind that every time you call where() with the third param set to false
     * (default), it will join the passed conditions to the previous stored list using
     * the AND operator. Also, using the same array key twice in consecutive calls to
     * this method will not override the previous value.
     *
     * ### Using expressions objects:
     *
     * ```
     *  $exp = $query->newExpr()->add(['id !=' => 100, 'author_id' != 1])->type('OR');
     *  $query->where(['published' => true], ['published' => 'boolean'])->where($exp);
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE (id != 100 OR author_id != 1) AND published = 1`
     *
     * Other Query objects that be used as conditions for any field.
     *
     * ### Adding conditions in multiple steps:
     *
     * You can use callable functions to construct complex expressions, functions
     * receive as first argument a new QueryExpression object and this query instance
     * as second argument. Functions must return an expression object, that will be
     * added the list of conditions for the query using the AND operator.
     *
     * ```
     *  $query
     *  ->where(['title !=' => 'Hello World'])
     *  ->where(function ($exp, $query) {
     *      $or = $exp->or_(['id' => 1]);
     *      $and = $exp->and_(['id >' => 2, 'id <' => 10]);
     *  return $or->add($and);
     *  });
     * ```
     *
     * * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE title != 'Hello World' AND (id = 1 OR (id > 2 AND id < 10))`
     *
     * ### Conditions as strings:
     *
     * ```
     *  $query->where(['articles.author_id = authors.id', 'modified IS NULL']);
     * ```
     *
     * The previous example produces:
     *
     * `WHERE articles.author_id = authors.id AND modified IS NULL`
     *
     * Please note that when using the array notation or the expression objects, all
     * values will be correctly quoted and transformed to the correspondent database
     * data type automatically for you, thus securing your application from SQL injections.
     * If you use string conditions make sure that your values are correctly quoted.
     * The safest thing you can do is to never use string conditions.
     *
     * @param string|array|callback|null $conditions The conditions to filter on.
     * @param array $types associative array of type names used to bind values to query
     * @param bool $overwrite whether to reset conditions with passed list or not
     * @return $this
     */
    public function where($conditions = null, $types = [], $overwrite = false);
}
