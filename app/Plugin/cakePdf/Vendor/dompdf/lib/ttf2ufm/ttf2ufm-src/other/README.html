<h4><tt>bz</tt></h4>
<!
--
>

A small program to draw the Bezier curves on an alphanumeric display.
The recommended way of uing it is to run it from xterm with "Tiny"
(if you want higher magnification) or "Unreadable" (if you want
higher resolution) font and as big window size as possible. The size
of the window can be obtained by running "<tt>stty -a</tt>". For everything else 
just "Use the source, Luke!"
<p>

<h4><tt>cmpf</tt></h4>
<!
----
>

A small program to compare the rendering of two supposedly
nearly-identical fonts at low resolutions. It requires the
T1LIB library. This program may be used to compare the
effect of various options of the converter on the resulting
fonts. Create two <tt>.pfa</tt> files, one with one set of options,
another with another set of options, then use this program
to compare them.
<p>

<h4><tt>dmpf</tt></h4>
<!
----
>

A small program to dump the bitmaps of all glyphs of the font
at low pixel sizes, up to 20 pixels. It requires the
T1LIB library. This program may be used to compare the
effect of changes in the T1LIB rasterizer and just for visual
search for rendering anomalies.
<p>

<h4><tt>lst.pl</tt></h4>
<!
------
>

A simple PERL script that generates an HTML file
with the full list of all characters in all
possible styles of the Variable-width and Fixed-width
fonts. This file is quite convenient to look
at the converted fonts in Netscape (or other
graphical browser).

<h4><tt>cntstems.pl</tt></h4>
<!
------
>

A simple PERL script that counts the required hint stack in the
interpreter to rasterize the glyphs of the font. May be quite
useful in search for missing glyphs which may be aborted due to
insufficient stack depth.

<h4><tt>showg</tt></h4>
<!
-----
>

A PERL script that draws the glyphs and their interesting
metrics (such as coordinates of the dots, hints and blue zones)
in PostScript. It works only with un-encoded font files generated
by <tt>ttf2pt1</tt>. The intended use is like:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>showg [-c <i>&lt;fontfile.t1a&gt;</i>]...  <i>&lt;fontfile.t1a&gt; &lt;glyph-to-draw&gt;</i>... &gt;file.ps</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>gv file.ps # start the Ghostscript viewer</tt>
<p>

As you can see, multiple glyphs may be specified. The glyphs may be
specified in one of three ways:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- as a decimal code (for example, <tt>43</tt> )
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- as a glyph name preceded by a slash (for example, <tt>/plus</tt> )
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- as a literal character preceded by a dot (for example, <tt>.+</tt> )
<p>

So for example the following command would draw the same glyph "left
parenthesis" three times:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>showg file.t1a 40 /parenleft .\( >/file.ps</tt>
<p>

Don't forget that some characters have to be protected from the shell
by backslash as shown above, or else the shell would try to interpret
them before passing to the program.
<p>

One file (given as the first argument) is considered the main file
but multiple files can be specified with option <b>-c</b> for visual comparison
of the outlines. The glyphs from the main file are drawn in black
and supplemented with coordinate grid and sidebars for hints. The
glyphs from the comparison files are drawn in slightly lighter colors 
(red, cyan, brown) and no supplemental information is provided for them. 
Each use of option <b>-c</b> adds one comparison file, this option may be used 
multiple times. If there are more than 3 comparison files the colors
repeat cyclically.
<p>

So for example the following command would draw the same glyph "left
parenthesis" from three files on the same page:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>showg -c fileA.t1a -c fileB.t1a file.t1a .\( >/file.ps</tt>
<p>

This program is quite valuable it you want to take a close-up view at 
the font.
<p>

The outlines are drawn in black, the ends of the curves and
lines are marked as dots, the first dots of the outlines
are fatter. The Blue Zones are drawn in light blue. The
substituted hints are marked in red, the global hints are
marked in blue. The coordinate grid is drawn in green.
The stems and the values of coordinates are for convenience
marked twice, on each size of the picture.
<p>

<h4><tt>showdf</tt></h4>
<!
------
>

A Perl script to find a list of differing glyphs in two versions of a font
file (for example, converted with different versions of <tt>ttf2pt1</tt> or
with different options given to ttf2pt1) and feed this list into the <tt>showg</tt> 
program for display.  The intended use is like:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>showdf <i>&lt;showg-location&gt;</i> <i>&lt;fontfile1.t1a&gt;</i> <i>&lt;fontfile2.t1a&gt;</i> &gt;file.ps</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>gv file.ps # start the Ghostscript viewer</tt>
<p>

If both <tt>showdf</tt> and <tt>showg</tt> scripts are located in the
same directory, the command would look like:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>./showdf ./showg font1.t1a font2.t1a &gt;file.ps</tt><br>
<p>

For decent results both font files should be converted from the same original
font and contain the same glyphs with the same names in the same order. 
Otherwise most probably all the glyphs will be included, or a failure may
happen if some glyph is not found in one of the files. It is also a good
idea to convert the fonts for comparison with hinting disabled, otherwise
the differences in hinting may trigger the otherwise equal glyphs to be shown.
