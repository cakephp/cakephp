The Translation Tables
----------------------

These translation tables are used to translate the Type 1 fonts between
different encodings of the same language.

The file names are supposed to have the suffix .tbl. Each file
describes one encoding, and all the tables for a given language
are stored in the same directory.

The file format is quite simple: just a sequence of rows in
format

<name> <decimal code>

The names do not have to conform to any standard, just the same
glyph must have the same name in all the files for a given language.

Not all the codes need to be described in the tables, the codes that
are not mentioned in the tables are left untranslated. So a file
of zero length may be used in case when no translation is neccessary.

The translation changes only the encoding table of the font and does not 
rename the glyphs in the font file.

Examples
--------

The directory `russian' contains the tables for some encodings of the 
Russian language: KOI-8, IBM CP-866, IBM CP-1251 and just for fun
ISO-8859/5 (nobody uses it anyways). The tables describe both russian
letters and table graphics characters (except for CP-1251 for which
the table graphics is not defined, so the table graphics portion for
it is just copied from KOI-8). 

The file for ISO-8859/1 is just a copy of file for KOI-8. It is neccessary
because Netscape has rather weird ideas about the documents in
KOI-8 encoding. The common way to fool Netscape is to set the KOI-8
fonts for the ISO-8859/1 encoding and set the default encoding
in Netscape to 8859/1.

The directory `latin1' contains an empty table for ISO-8859/1
because it does not need any translation.
