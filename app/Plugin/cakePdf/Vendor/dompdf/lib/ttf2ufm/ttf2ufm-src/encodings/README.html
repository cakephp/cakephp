The Translation Tables
</H3>
<!
----------------------
>

These translation tables are used to translate the Type 1 fonts between
different encodings of the same language.
<p>

The file names are supposed to have the suffix <tt>.tbl</tt>. Each file
describes one encoding, and all the tables for a given language
are stored in the same directory.
<p>

The file format is quite simple: just a sequence of rows in
format
<p>

<tt>
&lt;name&gt; &lt;decimal code&gt;
</tt>
<p>

The names do not have to conform to any standard, just the same
glyph must have the same name in all the files for a given language.
<p>

Not all the codes need to be described in the tables, the codes that
are not mentioned in the tables are left untranslated. So a file
of zero length may be used in case when no translation is neccessary.
<p>

The translation changes only the encoding table of the font and does not 
rename the glyphs in the font file.
<p>

Examples
</H3>
<!
--------
>

The directory `russian' contains the tables for some encodings of the 
Russian language: KOI-8, IBM CP-866, IBM CP-1251 and just for fun
ISO-8859/5 (nobody uses it anyways). The tables describe both russian
letters and table graphics characters (except for CP-1251 for which
the table graphics is not defined, so the table graphics portion for
it is just copied from KOI-8). 
<p>

The file for ISO-8859/1 is just a copy of file for KOI-8. It is neccessary
because Netscape has rather weird ideas about the documents in
KOI-8 encoding. The common way to fool Netscape is to set the KOI-8
fonts for the ISO-8859/1 encoding and set the default encoding
in Netscape to 8859/1.
<p>

The directory `latin1' contains an empty table for ISO-8859/1
because it does not need any translation.
