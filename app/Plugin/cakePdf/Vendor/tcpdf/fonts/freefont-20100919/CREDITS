* URW++ Design & Development GmbH <http://www.urwpp.de/>

under the terms of GNU General Public License (GPL).

* Yannis Haralambous <yannis.haralambous AT enst-bretagne.fr> and John
  Plaice <plaice AT omega.cse.unsw.edu.au>

Yannis Haralambous and John Plaice are the authors of Omega typesetting
system, <http://omega.enstb.org/>. Omega is an extension of TeX.
Its first release, aims primarily at improving TeX's multilingual abilities.
In Omega all characters and pointers into data-structures are 16-bit wide,
instead of 8-bit, thereby eliminating many of the trivial limitations of TeX.
Omega also allows multiple input and output character sets, and uses
programmable filters to translate from one encoding to another, to perform
contextual analysis, etc. Internally, Omega uses the universal 16-bit Unicode
standard character set, based on ISO-10646. These improvements not only make
it a lot easier for TeX users to cope with multiple or complex languages,
like Arabic, Indic, Khmer, Chinese, Japanese or Korean, in one document, but
will also form the basis for future developments in other areas, such as
native color support and hypertext features. ... Fonts for UT1 (omlgc family)
and UT2 (omah family) are under development: these fonts are in PostScript
format and visually close to Times and Helvetica font families. 
Omega fonts are available subject to GPL

Sai Micho, Chu Mincho, Cho Kaku and Saimaru. The font files are
written in custom file format, while tools for conversion into
Metafont and PostScript Type 1 are also supplied. The Wadalab Kanji
Comittee has later been dismissed, and the resulting files can be now
found on the FTP server of the Depertment of Mathematical Engineering
and Information Physics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Tokyo

* Young U. Ryu <ryoung AT utdallas.edu>

Young Ryu is the author of Txfonts, a set of mathematical symbols
designed to accompany text typeset in Times or its variants. In the
documentation, Young adresses the design of mathematical symbols: "The
Adobe Times fonts are thicker than the CM fonts. Designing math fonts
for Times based on the rule thickness of Times = , , + , / , < ,
etc. would result in too thick math symbols, in my opinion. In the TX
fonts, these glyphs are thinner than those of original Times
fonts. That is, the rule thickness of these glyphs is around 85% of
that of the Times fonts, but still thicker than that of the CM fonts."
TX fonts are are distributed under the GNU public license (GPL).

<http://www.metta.lk/fonts/> are released under GNU GPL, or,
precisely, "Public Domain under GNU Licence Produced by DMS
Electronics for The Sri Lanka Tipitaka Project" (taken from the font
comment), and took the effort of recoding the font to Unicode.

These glyphs were later replaced by those from the LKLUG font
<http://www.lug.lk/fonts/lklug>

Finally the range was completely replaced by glyphs from the sinh TeX
font, with much help and advice from Harshula Jayasuriya.

* K.H. Hussain <hussain AT kfri.org> and R. Chitrajan

`Rachana' in Malayalam means `to write', `to create'. Rachana Akshara Vedi,
a team of socially committed information technology professionals and
philologists, has applied developments in computer technology and desktop
publishing to resurrect the Malayalam language from the disorder,
fragmentation and degeneration it had suffered since the attempt to adapt
the Malayalam script for using with a regular mechanical typewriter, which
took place in 1967-69. K.H. Hussein at the Kerala Forest Research Institute
has released "Rachana Normal" fonts with approximately 900 glyphs required
to typeset traditional Malayalam. R. Chitrajan apparently encoded the
glyphs in the OpenType table.

In 2008, the Malayalam ranges in FreeSerif were updated under the advise 
and supervision of Hiran Venugopalan of Swathanthra Malayalam Computing,
to reflect the revised edition Rachana_04.
