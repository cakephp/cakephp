                          Installing GNU FreeFont
                          =======================

GNU FreeFont can be used in any modern operating system.

This document explains how to install FreeFont on some common systems.

UNIX/GNU/Linux/BSD Systems
--------------------------

FreeFont works with any system using the free font rasterizer FreeType
<http://www.freetype.org/>.

* Debian GNU/Linux

Users of Debian GNU/Linux system will probably want to use the Debian package,
available from the Debian site, 

	<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/ttf-freefont.html>,

or any of its mirrors.

Install them by issuing the command
	apt-get install ttf-freefont


* KDE local installation

Users of KDE can install .ttf files on a per-user basis using the KDE 
Control Center module "kcmfontinst", which may appear in the menu as

	Settings -> System Administration -> Font Installer

This is especially helpful for developers and testers.


* Generic X-windows

	1) Fetch the freefont-ttf.tar.gz package with Free UCS outline fonts
	   in the TrueType format.

	2) Unpack TrueType fonts into a suitable directory,
	   e.g. /usr/local/share/fonts/default/TrueType/

	3) If you have chosen any other directory, make sure the directory you
	   used to install the fonts is listed in the path searched by the X
	   Font Server by editing the config file in /etc/X11/.

	   In some systems, you list the directory in the item "catalogue="
	   in the file /etc/X11/fs/config.

	4) Run ttmkfdir in the directory where you unpacked the fonts.


Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP; Vista
-------------------------------

Note that in at least Vista, XP and 2000, the OpenType versions perform much
better than, and are recommended over, the TrueType ones.

* Vista:
	1) From the Start menu, open Control Panels
	2) Drag-n-drop font files onto Fonts control panel
           You may get a dialog saying
        	"Windows needs your permission to continue"
	   a) Click Continue

* 95/98/NT:
	The font installation is similar to Vista.

	In order to use OpenType, users of Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0 can
	install Adobe's 'Type Manager Light'.  It is available for download
	without cost from Adobe's web site.

	Otherwise, use the TrueType versions.

Mac OS X
--------

Installing on Mac OS X consists of moving the .ttf files to either
	/Library/Fonts/  or  ~/Library/Fonts/
depending on whether they should be available to all users on your system
or just to yourself.
