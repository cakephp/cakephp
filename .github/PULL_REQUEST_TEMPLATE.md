Please describe the reason for the changes you're proposing. If it is a large change, please open an issue to discuss first.

Always follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) when submitting a pull request. In particular, make sure existing tests still pass, and add tests for all new behavior. When fixing a bug, you may want to add a test to verify the fix.
