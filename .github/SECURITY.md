## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you’ve found a security issue in CakePHP, please use the following procedure
instead of the normal bug reporting system. Instead of using the bug tracker,
or one of the support forums please send an email to security [at] cakephp.org. Emails
sent to this address go to the CakePHP core team on a private mailing list.

For each report, we try to first confirm the vulnerability. Once confirmed,
the CakePHP team will take the following actions:

* Acknowledge to the reporter that we’ve received the issue, and are
  working on a fix. We ask that the reporter keep the issue confidential until we announce it.
* Get a fix/patch prepared.
* Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
* Release new versions of all affected versions.
* Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement
