# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of  
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who  
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating  
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free  
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender  
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,  
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

In essence: **Don't be Evil**, where...

* 'Evil' is: Discriminating others because of their language, gender, religion or reputation. Don't do that.
* 'Evil' is: Disregarding works of others because of their language, gender, religion or reputation. Don't do that.
* 'Evil' is: Harassing individuals or groups on Github, google groups or public IRC chat. Don't do that.
* 'Evil' is: Insulting others (limited amounts of swearing are tolerated, as long as the target are dead things, not beings). Don't do that.
* 'Evil' is: Intimidation and threats of violence. Don't do that.
* 'Evil' is: Being impatient and demanding. Don't do that.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or  
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions  
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or  
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,  
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to  
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing  
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of  
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces  
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be  
reported by contacting a project maintainer at conduct@cakefoundation.org. All  
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that  
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are  
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an  
incident.
