 * Eager loads a list of records in the target table that are related to another

 * first one is by passing a Query object setup to find on the source table and
 * the other way is by explicitly passing an array of primary key values from
 * the source table.
 *
 * The required way of passing related source records is controlled by "strategy"
 * By default the subquery strategy is used, which requires a query on the source
 * When using the select strategy, the list of primary keys will be used.
 *
 * Returns a closure that should be run for each record returned in an specific
 * Query. This callable will be responsible for injecting the fields that are
 * related to each specific passed row.

 *
 * - query: Query object setup to find the source table records
 * - keys: List of primary key values from the source table
 * - foreignKey: The name of the field used to relate both tables
 * - conditions: List of conditions to be passed to the query where() method
 * - sort: The direction in which the records should be returned
 * - fields: List of fields to select from the target table
 * - contain: List of related tables to eager load associated to the target table
 * - strategy: The name of strategy to use for finding target table records
