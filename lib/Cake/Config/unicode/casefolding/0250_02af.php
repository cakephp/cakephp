/**
 * The upper field is the decimal value of the upper case character
 *
 * The lower filed is an array of the decimal values that form the lower case version of a character.
 *
 *	The status field is:
 * C: common case folding, common mappings shared by both simple and full mappings.
 * F: full case folding, mappings that cause strings to grow in length. Multiple characters are separated by spaces.
 * S: simple case folding, mappings to single characters where different from F.
 * T: special case for uppercase I and dotted uppercase I
 *   - For non-Turkic languages, this mapping is normally not used.
 *   - For Turkic languages (tr, az), this mapping can be used instead of the normal mapping for these characters.
 *     Note that the Turkic mappings do not maintain canonical equivalence without additional processing.
 *     See the discussions of case mapping in the Unicode Standard for more information.
