/**
 * Model behavior base class.
 *
 * Defines the Behavior interface, and contains common model interaction functionality. Behaviors
 * allow you to simulate mixins, and create reusable blocks of application logic, that can be reused across
 * several models. Behaviors also provide a way to hook into model callbacks and augment their behavior.
 *
 * ### Mixin methods
 *
 * Behaviors can provide mixin like features by declaring public methods. These methods should expect
 * the model instance to be shifted onto the parameter list.
 *
 * {{{
 * function doSomething(Model $model, $arg1, $arg2) {
 *		//do something
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * Would be called like `$this->Model->doSomething($arg1, $arg2);`.
 *
 * ### Mapped methods
 *
 * Behaviors can also define mapped methods. Mapped methods use pattern matching for method invocation. This
 * allows you to create methods similar to Model::findAllByXXX methods on your behaviors. Mapped methods need to
 * be declared in your behaviors `$mapMethods` array. The method signature for a mapped method is slightly different
 * than a normal behavior mixin method.
 *
 * {{{
 * public $mapMethods = array('/do(\w+)/' => 'doSomething');
 *
 * function doSomething(Model $model, $method, $arg1, $arg2) {
 *		//do something
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * The above will map every doXXX() method call to the behavior. As you can see, the model is
 * still the first parameter, but the called method name will be the 2nd parameter. This allows
 * you to munge the method name for additional information, much like Model::findAllByXX.
 *
 * @package       Cake.Model
 * @see Model::$actsAs
 * @see BehaviorCollection::load()
