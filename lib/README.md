CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known
design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller
and MVC.  Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables
PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any
loss to flexibility.

## Installing CakePHP via composer

You can install CakePHP into your project using
[composer](http://getcomposer.org).  If you're starting a new project, we
recommend using the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp-app) as
a starting point. For existing applications you can add the following to your
`composer.json` file:

	"require": {
		"cakephp/framework": "dev-3.0"
	}

And run `php composer.phar update`
