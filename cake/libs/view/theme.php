/**
 * Theme view class
 *
 * Allows the creation of multiple themes to be used in an app. Theme views are regular view files
 * that can provide unique HTML and static assets.  If theme views are not found for the current view
 * the default app view files will be used. You can set `$this->theme` and `$this->view = 'Theme'` 
 * in your Controller to use the ThemeView.
 *
 * Example of theme path with `$this->theme = 'super_hot';` Would be `app/views/themed/super_hot/posts`
