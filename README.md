CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known
design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller
and MVC.  Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables
PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any
loss to flexibility.

## Installing CakePHP via composer

You can install CakePHP into your project using
[composer](http://getcomposer.org).  If you're starting a new project, we
recommend using the [app skeleton](https://github.com/cakephp/app) as
a starting point. For existing applications you can add the following to your
`composer.json` file:

	"require": {
		"cakephp/cakephp": "3.0.*-dev"
	}

And run `php composer.phar update`

## Running tests

Assuming you have PHPUnit installed system wide using one of the methods stated
[here](http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html), you can run the
tests for cakephp by doing the following:

1. Copy `phpunit.xml.dist` to `phpunit.xml`.
2. Add the relevant database credentials to your `phpunit.xml` if you want to run tests against
   a non-SQLite datasource.
3. Run `phpunit`.
